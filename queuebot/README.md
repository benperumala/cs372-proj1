# QueueBot

QueueBot is a Discord bot used for CS 120's office hours. It allows students to join a which TAs can then pull students off of when they are available.
Old CS 120 QueueBot code: <https://github.com/benperumala/cs120-queuebot/>

This repo has a mockup bot which does the same thing but without connecting to Discord's API (so it's easier to run and see how it works).
There are Rust crates that [allow for communication with Discord's API](https://github.com/SpaceManiac/discord-rs) so it is possible to extend this to an actual product
